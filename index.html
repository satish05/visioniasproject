		<h5>Testing Github </h5>
		<h4>Usually you do not invoke git merge without arguments (at least I don't know anyone who does). If you want that merge defaults to the tracking branch, you need to set merge.defaultToUpstream to true: git config merge.defaultToUpstream true. Your master branch has to track origin/master in this case: git branch --set-upstream master origin/master. This is done automagically if origin/master was already present when you cloned.</h4>
		<h3>This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit. This command adds new history to the project (it doesn't modify existing history).</h3>
	<h2> So instead of editing the earlier commit, revert introduces a new commit that reverses an earlier one. git reset is used to undo changes in your working directory that haven't been comitted yet. git checkout is used to copy a file from some other commit to your current working tree.</h2>
